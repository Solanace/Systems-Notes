## 11/06/17: Are your processes running? Then you should go out and catch them!

**More Command Line Arguments**

* `fgets(<DESTINATION>, <BYTES>, <FILE POINTER>)` - `<stdio.h>`
	* Reads in from a file stream and stores it in a string
	* Reads at most \<BYTES> - 1 characters from the pointer (adds a null at the end), including newlines
	* File pointer is type `FILE *`, more complex than a file descriptor
		* `stdin` is a file pointer
	* Stops at newlines, end of file, or byte limit
	* What if you wanted to read in numbers? Just use...
* `sscanf(<SOURCE STRING>, <FORMAT STRING>, <VAR 1>, <VAR 2>, ...)` - `<stdio.h>`
	* Scans a string and extracts values based on a format string

**Processes**

* Every running program is a process
* Programs can create subprocesses, but these are the same as regular processes
* A processor can handle 1 process per cycle or per core
* "Multitasking" only appears to happen due to the processor switching between all the active processes quickly
* pid
	* Unique identifiers for processes
	* pid 1 is the init process, always running
	* Each entry in the /proc directory is a current pid
	* The `ps` command in Terminal lists what processes are currently running
	* `ps -a` lists all processes across all accounts
	* `ps -ax` lists processes not attached to Terminals

## 11/03/17: Input? fgets about it!

* In [Work 08](https://github.com/iwang2/08_stat/blob/master/stat.c), we used `st_mode` in `struct stat`, which returned a 6-digit octal as opposed to the 3-digit one we were expecting
* To remove the first three digits, use the bitwise & operator:

```
Mode
_ _ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
         r w x  r w x  r w x
     &0b 1 1 1  1 1 1  1 1 1
```

**Command Line Arguments**

* `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
	* `argc` - number of command line arguments
	* `argv` - array of command line arguments
	* Program name is considered the first command line argument, e.g., `./a.out`
* `scanf(<FORMAT STRING>, <VAR 1>, <VAR 2>, ...)` - `<stdio.h>`
	* Reads in data from stdin using the format string to determine types and puts the data in each variable
	* Example:
	```C
	int x; float f; double d;
	scanf("%d %f %lf", &x, &f, *d);
	```
